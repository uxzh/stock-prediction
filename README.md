# 📈 Stock Prediction Research

Welcome to my stock prediction research repository! As an undergraduate student in Computer Science, I'm exploring various algorithms and techniques to predict stock market trends. This repository is a part of my Quantitative Finance research paper, where I apply my limited expertise to investigate the effectiveness of different approaches. 🎓📊

## 🔍 Overview

In this repository, you'll find a collection of Jupyter Notebook files, each focusing on a specific method or technique for stock prediction. I'm currently experimenting with Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks, a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that can learn long-term dependencies in sequential data. 🧠📉

Please keep in mind that I'm still learning and exploring these concepts, so my implementations may not be perfect. I'm open to feedback and suggestions from more experienced researchers and practitioners! 🙏

## 📁 Files

### 1. [7_day_LSTM_Amazon_Stock_Forecasting.ipynb](7_day_LSTM_Amazon_Stock_Forecasting.ipynb)

In this notebook, I use an LSTM model to forecast Amazon stock prices for the next 7 days. The model is trained on historical stock data and learns to predict future prices based on past trends. I experiment with different hyperparameters and evaluate the model's performance using metrics like Mean Squared Error (MSE) and Mean Absolute Error (MAE). 📅📈

### 2. [Amazon_Stock_Forecasting_with_LSTM.ipynb](Amazon_Stock_Forecasting_with_LSTM.ipynb)

This notebook focuses on predicting Amazon stock prices using an LSTM model. I preprocess the historical stock data, create a sliding window to generate input sequences, and train the LSTM model to predict the next day's closing price. I also visualize the model's predictions against the actual stock prices to assess its performance. 🔮📊

### 3. [Microsoft_Stock_Forecasting_with_LSTMs.ipynb](Microsoft_Stock_Forecasting_with_LSTMs.ipynb)

In this notebook, I apply the LSTM approach to predict Microsoft stock prices. I follow a similar process as the Amazon stock forecasting notebook, but with a focus on Microsoft's historical stock data. I train the LSTM model, evaluate its performance, and visualize the predictions to gain insights into the model's effectiveness. 🖥️📉

## 🚀 Future Work

I plan to continue adding more files to this repository as I explore different algorithms and techniques for stock prediction. Some potential areas I'm interested in investigating include:

- Ensemble methods: Combining multiple models to improve prediction accuracy. 🎨
- Sentiment analysis: Incorporating news sentiment and social media data into the prediction models. 📰🐦
- Reinforcement learning: Exploring how reinforcement learning can be applied to stock trading strategies. 🎮💰

Stay tuned for updates and new additions to this repository! 📣

## 🤝 Collaboration and Feedback

As an undergraduate researcher, I'm always eager to learn from others and improve my work. If you have any suggestions, feedback, or ideas for collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me at uxzh@pm.me. I'm excited to engage with the community and grow my knowledge in this fascinating field! 💬✨

Happy exploring and happy predicting! 🔭📈
